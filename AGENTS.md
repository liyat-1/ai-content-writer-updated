- Content Library cards own their channel and audience preview state so each card only exposes channels that campaign actually sends.
- Campaign-level Directful AI editing replaces the live preview in context and can minimize to a persistent rail without covering or resetting the editor.
- The package-level AI content planner renders inline above the calendar; campaign-level AI editing remains inside the review workspace's dynamic panel so context never disappears.
- Content release data lives in src/lib/releases.ts as one mock source for Content, Releases and Results.
- Releases and Results use one selected publication and its matching prior-period comparison; avoid unrelated analytics hierarchies.
- The year-round foundation remains live underneath seasonal publications; uncovered future months automatically use it until AI content is explicitly scheduled.
- AI editing transcripts and attachment composer controls use the installed AI Elements primitives so chat behavior stays accessible and consistent.
- Package AI planning opens as the sole full workspace, then minimizes into a purpose-built 440px assistant rail beside the calendar without resetting; narrower screens stack instead of compressing.
